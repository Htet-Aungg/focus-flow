## Project Overview

Focus Flow addresses the gap in task management tools that lack effective time-based prioritization. The application will enable users to:

- Create tasks with estimated completion time and priority levels
- Sort tasks by time to identify "quick wins"
- Filter by priority (P1/P2/P3) and completion status
- Persist data locally without requiring account creation

## Planned Features

### Must-Have (Minimum Viable Product)
-  Create, read, update, delete tasks (CRUD)
-  Assign priority levels (P1/P2/P3)
-  Estimate completion time for each task
-  Sort by estimated time
-  Filter by priority and completion status
-  LocalStorage persistence

### Should-Have
- Responsive design (desktop + tablet)
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility features

### Could-Have
- Dark mode
- Task categories/tags
- Export to CSV

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React 
- **Storage**: LocalStorage API
- **Styling**: CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS (TBD)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
