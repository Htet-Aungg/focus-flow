## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Timeline Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **React learning curve delays Sprint 1** | High | Medium | Allocate Weeks 13-14 for tutorials; use official docs | Buffer in Sprint 1 |
| **LocalStorage quota issues** | Medium | High | Test early (Sprint 1); implement NFR5 error handling | Addressed in Sprint 4 |
| **Scope creep** | Medium | High | Stick to Must-Have (FR1-FR10); defer Could-Have to Phase 5 | Review at each sprint |
| **Supervisor unavailability** | Low | Medium | Book meetings 2 weeks ahead; send email updates | N/A |
| **Report writing underestimated** | High | High | Draft chapters during development (Phase 4-5) | 3 weeks allocated |
| **Other coursework conflicts** | High | Medium | Front-load research in Term 1; heavy dev in Term 2 | Balanced workload |
| **Christmas break productivity loss** | Medium | Low | Use break for React learning and Chapter 2-3 drafts | Optional buffer |

---

## Dependencies

- **Ethics approval** must complete before any primary research (N/A for this project)
- **Requirements finalization** before Sprint 1 starts
- **Sprint 1 (CRUD)** before Sprint 2 (Edit) - cannot edit without create
- **Sprint 3 (Sorting)** requires Sprint 1 data structure
- **Testing phase** requires completed development
- **Report Chapter 5-6** require completed development and testing

---

## Holidays & Reading Weeks

- **Reading Week**: Week 12 (Dec 23-29) - consolidate research
- **Christmas Break**: Dec 30, 2024 - Jan 12, 2025 - optional study time
- **Easter Break**: Check UWE calendar (typically early April) - allocated to testing phase

---

## Notes

- Workload increases from **6 hrs/week (Oct-Nov)** to **22 hrs/week (Feb-Mar)**
- This reflects realistic final-year project patterns
- Other modules are lighter in Term 2, allowing more SDP time
- Supervisor meetings every 2 weeks ensure regular progress checks
- Report chapters drafted incrementally to avoid May bottleneck
