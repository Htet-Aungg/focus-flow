CHECKLIST QUESTIONS
| Yes/No | Explanation |
|-------:|-------------|
| 1. Does the proposed project involve human tissue, human participants, animals, environmental damage, or the NHS? | No. The project is a software build with no participant data collection. |
| 2. Will participants be clearly asked to give consent to take part in the research and informed about how data collected in the research will be used? | N/A (no participants). |
| 3. If they choose, can a participant withdraw at any time (prior to a point of “no return” in the use of their data)? Are they told this? | N/A (no participants). |
| 4. Are measures in place to provide confidentiality for participants and ensure secure management and disposal of data collected from them? | N/A (no participants). |
| 5. Does the study involve people who are particularly vulnerable or unable to give informed consent (e.g., children or people with learning difficulties)? | No. |
| 6. Could your research cause stress, physical or psychological harm to humans or animals, or environmental damage? | No. |
| 7. Could any aspects of the research lead to unethical behaviour by participants or researchers (e.g., invasion of privacy, deceit, coercion, fraud, abuse)? | No. |
