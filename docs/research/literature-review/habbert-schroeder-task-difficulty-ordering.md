## Summary  

Across six experiments plus a supplemental study (N = 2013), the authors test whether doing difficult tasks first (“eat the frog”) or last better supports self‑efficacy. People *predict* that leaving difficult tasks for later will make them feel more efficacious, but actually performing tasks in **increasing easiness** (hard‑to‑easy) order improves or maintains self‑efficacy more than easy‑to‑hard or random ordering  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020). Findings show a robust mismatch between intuitions about task ordering and its real psychological effect on perceived competence  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020).

### Evidence Overview for Task‑Order Effectiveness

| Aspect | Finding | Citations |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Predicted vs. actual efficacy | People *believe* doing hardest tasks later boosts efficacy, but *actually* it lowers or doesn’t improve it  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020)|  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020)|
| Productivity/decision‑making | Hard‑to‑easy order strengthens self‑efficacy, a key driver of persistence and goal‑directed choices  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020)|  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020)|

## Key Points Relevant to Focus Flow  

- **Point 1**: People systematically mispredict which task order (easy‑to‑hard vs. hard‑to‑easy) will build efficacy. They prefer to delay difficult tasks, believing this will increase efficacy, but it actually reduces or fails to improve self‑efficacy  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020).  
  - **Relevance**: Supports designing FR6–FR8 style features that *nudge users toward “eat‑the‑frog” ordering* when prioritizing tasks (e.g., Eisenhower Matrix categories) to protect confidence and reduce avoidance.  

- **Point 2**: Completing tasks in **increasing easiness (hard‑to‑easy)** order tends to yield higher self‑efficacy than increasing‑difficulty or random order across multiple lab tasks  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020).  
  - **Relevance**: Provides empirical backing that prioritization schemes which surface one or two “frogs” first can improve perceived capability, persistence, and thus productivity/flow, informing decision‑support logic and workload sequencing (NFR1: effectiveness).  

- **Point 3**: The authors show the error is driven by mental simulation: people overweight the *start* of the sequence (how bad the first hard task feels) rather than the *end* (how good ending with easy tasks feels)  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020).  
  - **Relevance**: Suggests UX messaging and explanations should correct this bias (e.g., micro‑copy: “Starting with one hard task now will make the rest feel easier”) to improve decision‑making about priorities.

## Quotes to Use in Report  

> “We conclude that people’s tendency to delay the difficult incurs unexpected costs to self‑worth. To build efficacy, people should start with their hardest task, even though doing so may violate intuition.” (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020, Abstract)  

> “In predicted‑efficacy studies, participants preferred completing tasks in increasing‑difficulty order, yet in actual‑efficacy studies this ordering reduced or did not meaningfully improve self‑efficacy relative to increasing‑easiness order.” (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020,)

## Critique/Limitations  

- Laboratory tasks (short, controlled activities) may not fully mirror complex real‑world workloads or long projects, so generalisability to daily knowledge work is limited  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020).  
- The paper examines **ordering of difficulty**, not named frameworks like Eisenhower or MoSCoW directly, so applying results to those models is theoretically grounded but indirect  (Habbert and Schroeder, 2020).  
- Outcomes focus on **self‑efficacy**, not objective performance over weeks or months; your project can address this by logging both *subjective* confidence and *objective* completion/throughput when users adopt “eat‑the‑frog”‑style prioritization.
