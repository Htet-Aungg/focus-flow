## Summary
The paper tests whether **mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII)** improves time management. Across three studies, students and working mothers who used MCII scheduled more study time, reported better time management, and attended vocational classes more regularly than control groups, showing that a brief cognitive self‑regulation technique can measurably improve how people allocate and use time  (Oettingen et al., 2015).

## Key Points Relevant to Focus Flow
- **Point 1**: MCII combines imagining desired future outcomes with contrasting present obstacles, then forming “if–then” plans  (Oettingen et al., 2015).  
  - **Relevance**: Can directly inform FR6–FR8 by embedding short MCII-style prompts (future + obstacle + if–then plan) when users set focus goals.

- **Point 2**: Students using MCII scheduled more time for important academic tasks and improved self‑reported time management over a week compared to control strategies  (Oettingen et al., 2015).  
  - **Relevance**: Supports NFR1 (sustained behaviour change) by showing that a light‑weight cognitive intervention can change real scheduling behaviour, not just intentions.

- **Point 3**: Study 3 showed working mothers in a vocational program attended classes more regularly after MCII training  (Oettingen et al., 2015).  
  - **Relevance**: Suggests Focus Flow could help users with high life demands (e.g., work + study) stick to planned focus sessions via structured if–then plans and reminders.

## Quotes to Use in Report
> “Mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII) has been found to improve self‑regulation across many life domains. The present research investigates whether MCII can benefit time management.” (Oettingen et al., 2015, p.XX)  (Oettingen et al., 2015)> “Performing MCII on one’s everyday concerns improved how participants scheduled their time and enhanced self‑reported time management.” (Oettingen et al., 2015, p.XX)  (Oettingen et al., 2015)---

## Critique/Limitations
- Conducted mainly with students and a specific group of working mothers; generalisability to other populations and long‑term effects is uncertain  (Oettingen et al., 2015).  
- Focuses on self‑report and behavioural indicators over relatively short time frames; does not test digital or app‑based implementations.  
- Focus Flow can address gaps by testing MCII-style prompts at scale, logging long‑term behavioural data, and adapting the intervention to diverse users and contexts.
