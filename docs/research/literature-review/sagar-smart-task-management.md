## Summary
The paper presents **BrightHuman**, a smart web‑based task management application designed with user‑centred methods, IEEE standards, and an intuitive interface to improve productivity. It combines task creation, categorisation, intelligent prioritisation, scheduling, reminders, collaboration features, and analytics in a dashboard that supports users’ daily workflows  (Sagar et al., 2025). Usability testing indicates a 25% improvement in task completion efficiency and positive results against IEEE 9241 HCI standards  (Sagar et al., 2025).

## Key Points Relevant to Focus Flow
- **Point 1**: User‑centred requirements gathered via surveys, interviews and competitor analysis (Trello, Asana, MS To Do, Notion) informed critical features and areas for improvement  (Sagar et al., 2025).  
  - **Relevance**: Supports FR6–FR8 by showing concrete UX expectations for task apps (simple task input, clear lists, collaboration) and validates doing early user research + competitor review for Focus Flow.

- **Point 2**: UX features include NLP‑based task categorisation, a BrightHuman Priority Score (BHPS), intelligent scheduling around users’ productive hours, proactive deadline alerts, and rescheduling of incomplete tasks  (Sagar et al., 2025).  
  - **Relevance**: Directly informs Focus Flow’s core UX: automatic prioritisation, smart time‑blocking for deep work, and gentle notifications that protect flow while keeping users on track (NFR1: sustained engagement).

- **Point 3**: The interface is built using MVC with React.js front‑end, interactive dashboards (Gantt charts, Kanban boards, summary views) and analytics such as “you are most productive between 9–11 AM”  (Sagar et al., 2025).  
  - **Relevance**: Suggests concrete UI patterns (Kanban, calendar, productivity insights) and architecture choices that can be reused or simplified in Focus Flow to visualise focus streaks and peak‑focus windows.

## Critique/Limitations
- Focuses on web‑based task management; less discussion of mobile UX patterns, micro‑interactions, or distraction management that are critical for a focus app.  
- UX evaluation details are fairly high‑level; limited insight into qualitative pain points or long‑term adherence.  
- Focus Flow can extend this work by: prioritising distraction‑free modes, modelling deep‑work sessions (not just tasks), and running longitudinal UX studies on habit formation and sustained focus.
