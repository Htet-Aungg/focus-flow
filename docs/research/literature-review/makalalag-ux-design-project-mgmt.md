## Summary
The study designs a **mobile-based project and task management application** UI/UX using the **design thinking** process to support users with high mobility  (Makalalag et al., 2021). By applying user research and a flat visual design, the authors aim to create an interface that is easy to perceive and operate, concluding that the resulting design helps users manage projects and tasks more effectively  (Makalalag et al., 2021).

## Key Points Relevant to Focus Flow
- **Point 1**: Use of the design thinking method to uncover user needs and pain points for managing projects/tasks on mobile, especially for users who are often on the move  (Makalalag et al., 2021).  
  - **Relevance**: Supports doing early qualitative research and iterative prototyping for Focus Flow’s FR6–FR8 (task creation, focus sessions, scheduling) rather than jumping straight to features.

- **Point 2**: Adoption of **flat design** to simplify perception and interaction, making content easier to “capture and use” on small screens  (Makalalag et al., 2021).  
  - **Relevance**: Justifies a clean, minimal UI for Focus Flow that emphasizes focus sessions and priorities, reducing cognitive load (NFR1: low-friction, low-distraction experience).

- **Point 3**: Emphasis on mobile UX for high‑mobility users and evidence that users “are helped by the application” and find benefits for managing projects and tasks  (Makalalag et al., 2021).  
  - **Relevance**: Aligns with designing Focus Flow as mobile‑first, with quick capture, easy rescheduling, and glanceable views for users switching contexts frequently.

## Critique/Limitations
- Focuses on design phase; limited empirical data on long‑term productivity or behaviour change  (Makalalag et al., 2021).  
- Mobile UX is discussed at a high level; few concrete interaction patterns or detailed usability metrics.  
- Focus Flow can extend this by A/B testing specific focus‑oriented patterns (timers, blocking, nudges) and collecting longitudinal engagement and outcome data.
