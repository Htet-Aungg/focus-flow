## Summary
The paper surveys **client-side storage mechanisms**—cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB—covering their functionality, typical use cases, limitations, and security/privacy implications  (Sinha, 2020). It emphasizes choosing storage based on data sensitivity, performance needs, regulatory requirements (GDPR/CCPA), and app patterns such as e‑commerce and content platforms  (Sinha, 2020).

## Key Points Relevant to Focus Flow
- **Point 1**: Different mechanisms target different needs: cookies for server communication, Web Storage for simple key–value state, IndexedDB for larger structured data  (Sinha, 2020).  
  - **Relevance**: For Focus Flow, use `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` for lightweight UI state and IndexedDB for larger offline task data instead of overloading cookies.

- **Point 2**: Security and privacy are core concerns; client storage is vulnerable to XSS, misuse for tracking, and regulatory non‑compliance if used for identifiable or behavioral data without controls  (Sinha, 2020; Al-Rousan, 2019).  
  - **Relevance**: Supports strict separation of sensitive data (keep server-side or encrypted) and explicit consent for any analytic/behavioral storage.

- **Point 3**: Best practices include minimal data retention, encryption for sensitive fields, clear deletion strategies, and aligning storage choices with GDPR/CCPA principles like data minimization and purpose limitation  (Sinha, 2020; Al-Rousan et al., 2019; MacFadden & Qiu, 2022).  
  - **Relevance**: Can be turned into NFRs for Focus Flow: transparent data policies, “clear local data” controls, and encrypted-at-rest strategies if tasks can contain sensitive notes.

## Quotes to Use in Report
> Client-side storage mechanisms “must be selected and configured with careful attention to security, privacy regulations, and application performance requirements.” (Sinha, 2020, p.XX)  (Sinha, 2020)---

## Critique/Limitations
- High-level survey; limited empirical benchmarks or concrete code-level patterns  (Sinha, 2020).  
- Focuses broadly on many app types, so recommendations for productivity/task apps are not deeply specialized.
