## Summary  

The paper reviews **modern task prioritization methods** used in agile software development (Scrum, Kanban), grouping them into approaches based on developer opinions (e.g. **MoSCoW**, user story mapping) and those based on **quantitative assessment** (e.g. Kano model, evaluation sheets, Quality Function Deployment)  (Lytvynov et al., 2020). It explains where each technique fits (short‑term vs long‑term planning) and highlights trade‑offs in how they support decision‑making about what to do first in dynamic projects  (Lytvynov et al., 2020).

### Methods & Use Cases Overview

| Type of method | Examples | Typical use | Citations |
|----------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Opinion‑based | MoSCoW, user story mapping, proactive improvement | Align team & stakeholders in agile backlogs |  (Lytvynov et al., 2020)|
| Quantitative   | Kano, evaluation sheets, QFD | Score tasks on value, risk, profit, etc. |  (Lytvynov et al., 2020)|

## Key Points Relevant to Focus Flow  

- **Point 1**: The paper splits methods into **team‑opinion‑driven** (MoSCoW, story mapping) vs **metric‑driven** (Kano, evaluation sheets, QFD)  (Lytvynov et al., 2020).  
  - **Relevance**: Lets you justify offering multiple modes in your app: quick subjective prioritization (MoSCoW‑style tags) and more structured scoring views (FR6–FR8).  

- **Point 2**: MoSCoW and story mapping are described as **popular and actively used** for agile teams needing to reorder tasks frequently  (Lytvynov et al., 2020).  
  - **Relevance**: Supports including MoSCoW as a core option for backlog / task‑list prioritization to improve decision‑making and workload clarity.  

- **Point 3**: Quantitative methods propose **multi‑criteria evaluation sheets** where tasks are scored on importance, profit, dependency, risk, etc., then summed into a priority value  (Lytvynov et al., 2020).  
  - **Relevance**: Direct blueprint for a scoring engine in your system (NFR1 effectiveness; explainable ranking).

## Quotes to Use in Report  

> “Among the considered prioritization methods, which take into account the opinion of the development team, there are such popular and actively used nowadays methods as MoSCoW, story map (User story mapping) and proactive improvement.” (Lytvynov et al., 2020, p.XX)  

> “Depending on the features of the project… one or several prioritization methods can be used at the same time or in combination.” (Lytvynov et al., 2020, p.XX)  

*(Replace p.XX with actual page numbers.)*

## Critique/Limitations  

- Conceptual/overview article: no experiments or quantified productivity impacts of MoSCoW vs others  (Lytvynov et al., 2020).  
- Focused on **software projects**, so transfer to personal productivity or generic task apps is reasoned but indirect  (Lytvynov et al., 2020).  
- Does not cover Eisenhower Matrix or “Eat the Frog”; your project can integrate these and log comparative outcomes (completion rate, decision time, perceived workload) to fill that empirical gap.
