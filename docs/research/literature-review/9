## Summary
ISO/IEC 9126-1 defines a **software product quality model** that decomposes quality into six top‑level characteristics—functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability—each further refined into sub‑characteristics with associated measurable attributes  (Bevan, 1998; Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004). The standard is intended as a general-purpose reference for specifying, evaluating, and comparing software quality, to be tailored via a quality requirements study for each project context  (Bevan, 1998). It underpins later standards (ISO/IEC 25000 SQuaRE, ISO/IEC 25010) and is widely used as a foundation for metrics, defect classification, and quality evaluation frameworks  (Bevan, 1998; Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004; Vetrò et al., 2012; Yılmaz and Tarhan, 2022).

## Key Points Relevant to an NFR Framework

- **Point 1 – Six characteristics as NFR categories**  
  ISO/IEC 9126 defines six broad categories: **functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, portability**, each with sub‑characteristics (e.g., suitability, accuracy, fault tolerance, learnability, time behaviour) mapped to measurable attributes  (Bevan, 1998; Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004).  
  - **Application**: Use these six as the main NFR headings and derive concrete NFRs from their sub‑characteristics (e.g., “time behaviour” → response‑time targets; “fault tolerance” → graceful degradation requirements).

- **Point 2 – Link between quality model and measurement**  
  The 9126 family not only names characteristics but associates them with **metrics and evaluation procedures**, enabling more objective assessment of non‑functional requirements  (Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004; Sholiq et al., 2021; Sholiq et al., 2018).  
  - **Application**: For each NFR, attach at least one 9126‑aligned metric (e.g., defect density for reliability, task completion rate for usability) so that NFRs are verifiable rather than purely descriptive.

- **Point 3 – Tailoring and completeness checks**  
  ISO/IEC 9126 is positioned as a **checklist**: projects should select and prioritize relevant characteristics/sub‑characteristics through a quality requirements study and can use the model to classify defects and evaluate coverage of NFRs  (Bevan, 1998; Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004; Vetrò et al., 2012; Yılmaz and Tarhan, 2022).  
  - **Application**: In NFR workshops, walk through all 9126 characteristics to identify gaps (e.g., portability often overlooked), and use the taxonomy to tag user stories, defects, and tests with their impacted quality attributes.

|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Functionality  | Functions, suitability, accuracy, security             | “Support role‑based access with audit trail.”    |  (Bevan, 1998; Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004)|
| Reliability    | Maturity, fault tolerance, recoverability              | “99.9% uptime; MTTR < 1 hour.”                   |  (Bevan, 1998; Vetrò et al., 2012; Sholiq et al., 2018)|
| Usability      | Understandability, learnability, operability           | “New users complete core task within 5 minutes.” |  (Bevan, 1998; Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004)|
| Efficiency     | Time behaviour, resource utilization                   | “p95 response time < 2s under peak load.”        |  (Bevan, 1998; Sholiq et al., 2021; Kartiko, 2019)|
| Maintainability| Analyzability, changeability, stability, testability   | “High‑severity defects fixed within 2 days.”     |  (Bevan, 1998; Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004; Vetrò et al., 2012)|
| Portability    | Adaptability, installability, coexistence, replaceability | “Operate on three major OS/browser platforms.” |  (Bevan, 1998; Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004)|

## Quotes to Use in Report
> ISO/IEC 9126 “defines six broad categories of software quality: functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability and portability,” each broken into sub‑characteristics with measurable attributes  (Bevan, 1998).  

> “The ISO/IEC 9126 characteristics and subcharacteristics provide a useful checklist of issues related to quality. The actual characteristics … relevant in any particular situation … should be identified by a quality requirements study.”  (Bevan, 1998)---

## Critique/Limitations
- ISO/IEC 9126 is **superseded** by ISO/IEC 25010 within the SQuaRE series, which expands and reorganizes quality characteristics (e.g., explicit security and compatibility)  (Gobov and Zuieva, 2025; Birla, 2014).  
- Empirical work notes some ambiguity and overlap among 9126 attributes, requiring tailoring and clear definitions for consistent use  (Jung, Kim and Chung, 2004; Vetrò et al., 2012).  
- For modern systems, 9126 is best used as a **conceptual scaffold**; detailed NFRs and metrics should, where possible, be cross‑checked against the newer ISO/IEC 25010/2502x measurement standards  (Gobov and Zuieva, 2025; Valdés-Souto, Nunez-Varela and Pérez-González, 2019; Birla, 2014).
