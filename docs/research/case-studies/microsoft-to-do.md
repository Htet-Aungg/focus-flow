## Feature Analysis

### Core Features Present

| Feature | Description | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Task creation | Simple form: title + notes + due date | No duration field |
| My Day | Curated daily list | Manual selection required |
| Lists | Multiple lists (work, personal, etc.) | Not priority-based |
| Sorting | By due date, alphabetical, creation date | No time-based sort |

### Features Missing (Gap Analysis)

- **No estimated time field**: Users can't plan based on available time
- **No automatic sorting by duration**: Must manually pick "quick wins"

## UI/UX Observations

- Good use of whitespace
- Clear visual hierarchy

### Design Patterns to Adopt

## Technical Observations

- **Data Persistence**: Cloud sync (not applicable to Focus Flow)
- **Synchronization**: Real-time across devices (requires backend)
- **Offline Capability**: Limited without cloud

---

## Competitive Positioning

### Strengths vs Focus Flow

- Simple, intuitive interface (we should match this)
- My Day feature encourages daily planning (we could adopt)

### Gaps Focus Flow Can Fill

- No time-based sorting or estimated duration
- No quick-win filtering (tasks by completion time)
- No "focus mode" for minimizing distractions

---

## Key Insights for Focus Flow

1. **Simplicity is crucial**: Users prefer clean, minimal interfaces
2. **Daily planning**: A curated daily view improves engagement
3. **Time estimation matters**: Users want to estimate task duration for planning
4. **Visual feedback**: Animations improve user satisfaction (checkbox completion)
